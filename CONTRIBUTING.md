Pull requests are welcome. As long as your proposed new functionality is grounded and proved to work with Unit tests, we will make effort to pass them easily. Mind the license of the project.

You can also comment on our own (on generally other) pull requests on this project. There is no reason why we would not take grounded remarks and suggestions into consideration.
