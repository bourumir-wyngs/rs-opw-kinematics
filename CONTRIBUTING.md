Pull requests are welcome. 
Proprietary dependencies are not allowed.
We care a lot about backward compatibility.

You can also comment on our own (or generally other) pull requests on this project. 
There is no reason why we would not take grounded remarks and suggestions into consideration.

If you fork this repository, mind that the LICENSE is also forked, and if we find it like this,
we consider the LICENSE still valid. This means, if you fork and make changes, we may pick these changes
even if you do not open the pull request.
